# Scraping-Twitter-Data
This repository gives step by step guide of how to scrape twitter data using tweepy.
Here we are using tweepy to scrape twitter data for a particular topic.
Inorder to scrape data using tweepy you need (Consumer Key,Consumer Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret), to get these keys you need to apply for a twitter developer account.
After getting them you can see the file for how to use tweepy.

Note: 
Tweepy only allows maximum 7 days old data to be scraped so you cannot use (until & since) statements in tweepy to get data for a particular timeline. I am unware whether         its restricted only for my developer account or since my account was a basic one as a result I was unable to scrape data for past years as I was unable to scrape for same and it showed error when I used since & until statements.
